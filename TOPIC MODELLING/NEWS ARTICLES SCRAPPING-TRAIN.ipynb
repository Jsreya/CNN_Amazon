       "[' The Sikkim Progressive Youth Forum has threatened to take to the streets if the government fails to upgrade facilities at state hospitals and ensure free medicine and health services by November 30.\\nIn a release issued on Monday, SPYF said the government had failed to deliver on the twin demands despite the assurance given to the forum by health minister Dr M.K. Sharma in February. \"We have no choice other than to issue an ultimatum to the government to fulfill the twopoint demands within Nov 30 2020, else, we will take to the streets,\" said the forum.\\nIn February, the SPYF had submitted a memorandum to the minister along with 10,000 signatures of the public in support of its demands for upgrading facilities at government hospitals according to the Indian Public Health Standard (IPHS) guidelines and provision for free medical services and medicines to the people. ‘Dr Sharma had assured us that our demands would be fulfilled within two months of the budget session, but the condition of the hospitals continue to remain the same even after five months of the budget session,’ it regretted.\\nThe SPYF said district hospitals apart, even the condition of primary health centres was in a pathetic state. “The condition of PHCs is so bad that people hardly go there. They are only there in name,” it alleged.\\nThe SPYF has been spearheading the campaign to upgrade health facilities in the state for two-and-a-half years. Besides the signature campaign, it had held mass movements on three different occasions. The forum had also organised ‘Gangtok Chalo’ march from Geyzing in West Sikkim to Gangtok in January 2019 to highlight the abysmal condition of the Geyzing District Hospital.\\nAdvertisement\\nPowered By PLAYSTREAM',\n",
       " ' Rup Narayan Rai, a former chairman of the Sikkim Tourism Development Corporation, was arrested on the charges of sexually assaulting a minor girl after he surrendered before South Sikkim police on Monday.\\nRai, 53, had been absconding since Friday night after a family member of the victim had lodged a complaint of sexual assault against Rai at the Melli police station. The police had launched a search for Rai in South Sikkim.\\nRai is alleged to have assaulted the 13-year-old at his house in Sadam village on several occasions. The girl from a remote village in the South Sikkim had been staying with his family for the past few months to pursue her education.\\nThe police have said Rai has been booked under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. “He will be produced in a court in Namchi (South Sikkim) in 24 hours,” said Prawin Gurung, the deputy inspector general of police, Range.\\nThe Sikkim Democratic Front, under whose government Rai had served as the STDC chairman, suspended him until the completion of the process of law.',\n",
       " ' Sikkim police on Monday filed a case against two visiting technicians who tested positive for Covid-19 for allegedly violating the Covid-19 protocol and endangering the lives of others.\\nThe duo were part of a five-member team from Calcutta and Delhi and visited Gangtok on August 6 for maintenance work at State Data Centre at the IT department’s invitation.\\nIT secretary Mrinalini Shrivastava sought special permission from the East Sikkim administration for the team’s entry. Granting permission, the district administration had stated that the team would have to undergo rapid antigen test at the entry point, and travel to their places of work and stay in an ambulance under police cover at all times.\\nDuring their week-plus stay, the team visited other places and met some MLAs, including Aditya Golay, son of chief minister P.S. Tamang (Golay), and bureaucrats at meetings facilitated by the IT department. Two team members tested positive on Sunday.\\nThe police filed a case against the two under IPC sections for disobedience of public order and endangering lives of others, and for refusing to comply with the government directive under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.\\nS. C. Gupta, the state’s chief secretary, sought an explanation from IT secretary Shrivastava on the issue.\\nSince some meetings took place at the Tashiling secretariat in Gangtok, the entire complex has been declared as a containment zone.\\nThe incident created a furore in Sikkim with many wondering why the administration had not acted with same alacrity against politicians and bureaucrats as they did against the technician duo.',\n",
       " ' The Sikkim Drug Users’ Forum (SDUF) has expressed fears that HIV prevention activities may have taken a back seat in Sikkim because of an allegedly lax state health department amid the Covid-19 pandemic.\\nForum president Rinzing Bhutia said HIV prevention programme should not be derailed despite the prevailing Covid pandemic.\\n“An emerging public health crisis should not be the reason to derail the handling of an existing crisis,” she said.\\nCiting an example of the department’s alleged casual attitude, Bhutia said a counsellor attached to the oral substitute therapy (OST) centre at Jorethang Hospital and a technician at the integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC) at Namchi District Hospital were transferred over a year back, but their replacements had not yet arrived.\\nEven more perplexing is the fact that the two persons who had been transferred worked for the State AIDS Control Society under the National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) of the Union health ministry, she said.\\nBhutia added that the two persons who were transferred had been trained and experienced persons. Such transfers affect the continuity of effective HIV service deliveries, she said.\\n“Ideally, we would want the department to retransfer both to their original places of posting instead of giving replacements,” she added.\\nThe SDUF president also said her organisation had written to Sikkim health minister M.K. Sharma on July 6 on the issue, but got no response.\\n“If there is no positive action on the issue, the health minister will be held accountable for any loss of life and the spread of new HIV infections in the state,” she warned.\\nSources said Sikkim now has a little over 200 patients under antiretroviral therapy, or the HIV treatment regime.\\nThe Telegraph could not contact the health minister on phone despite repeated attempts.\\nThe Sikkim Drug Users’ Forum initiates community-led action for the health and rights of the people who use drugs.\\nThe SDUF has said that during the Covid-induced lockdown in Sikkim, it has been “tirelessly delivering crucial life-saving medicines to people suffering from HIV”, among others.']"
